      Hacking is something that I've been fond of ever since I discovered the
      internet back in 1999.

      At that time, my first - somewhat technical - hacking attempt involved
      cloning the Yahoo! Mail page, changing the form method from POST to GET,
      setting it as start page at computers from internet caf√©s and later coming
      back and checking the browser history.

      Recently, after 7 years of
      <a href='http://shotgundebugging.blogspot.com/' target='_blank'>
        working as a web developer</a> I decided it was
      time for a sabbatical. I started exploring new things and ended up
      trying bug bounties. I enjoyed the thrill of it and decided web security
      was something worth digging deeper into. So here it is.

      Trivia: <em>Securist</em> was the name given to agents of the
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitate' target='_blank'>secret police of the
        Socialist Republic of Romania</a>.
